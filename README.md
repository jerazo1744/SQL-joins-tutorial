SQL JOINS TUTORIAL

This git repo contains 3 csv files: customers, orders, and products. All files have only 10 entries. 

This is all fake/randomly generated data meant for practice purposes.

You can find the tutorial for this repo on my medium blog post: https://bit.ly/351oMHI.

The customers CSV file contains:
- customer_id
- first_name
- last_name
- address
- city
- state
- zipcode

The orders CSV file contains:
- order_id
- customer_id
- product_id
- order_date
